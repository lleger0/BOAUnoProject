# BOAUnoProject

A simple game of the classic Uno Game that you can play in the command line with friends (or foes)!


Rules: Each player is distributed 7 cards. One card will be drawn from the pile and placed it in the middle of everyone.

At the beginning of the turn, the player can choose his card by matching the number or color from the center-placed card.

If the card is matched then the game continues to the next player.

If it’s not matched then you can draw any of the special cards from your hand. It can be a Wild Card or Wild draw 4 card.

If none of the cards matched (face cards or special cards) then the player has to pick the top card from the draw pile and ends their turn.

Also, don’t forget to throw special cards in between to stop others from winning and also for adding spice to the game.

The player who finishes their cards earlier wins the game.
